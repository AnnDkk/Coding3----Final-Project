# Introduction
The Deep Dream model cleverly uses the machine learning principle of overprocessing the identified features, which attracted me deeply. In pursuing machine learning with higher accuracy, there is a model and algorithm that can see its special. And people through this "special" produce interesting arts which show the creativity of artificial intelligence. After my research, I generated a lot of artwork that I worked with AI by understanding and using the various layers and channels in the model. And this triggered my new inspiration for the project.

# Research on Deep Dream Model
According to the article <Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks> [1] , I learned about the algorithm used in Deep Dream:
</div>
Traditional deep learning uses gradient descent to minimize loss. However, this model uses the principle of gradient ascent to process images. It tries to maximize the expression of the identified single feature by increasing the activation value, so as to visually express the characteristics and styles of the picture seen by the machine at each level.

Deep Dream mainly uses the Inceptionism model. In the paper, they used random noise and augmented inputs in a specific way to show what the neural network thinks some objects look like.
Even though these outputs can be regulated by people rewriting parameters and code. But I still think it's a cool expression! It might be a possible source of some art! So I made a first attempt in the code: to represent the features identified by some layers in InceptionismV3 with random noise.
