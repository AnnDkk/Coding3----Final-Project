# Introduction
The Deep Dream model cleverly uses the machine learning principle of overprocessing the identified features, which attracted me deeply. In pursuing machine learning with higher accuracy, there is a model and algorithm that can see its special. And people through this "special" produce interesting arts which show the creativity of artificial intelligence. After my research, I generated a lot of artwork that I worked with AI by understanding and using the various layers and channels in the model. And this triggered my new inspiration for the project.
